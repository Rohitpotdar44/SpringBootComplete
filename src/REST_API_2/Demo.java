    // we are learning REST API through one project of journaling app -> see E DRIVE SPRING BOOT PROJECT 1 -->journalApplication

    /*
    Rest means ****representational state transfer*** and API means application program interface


    User can access the server through rest api

    let's take a example of netflix plan page so consider url is 172.17.18.19/netflix/plans
    but through url only we are not able to  contact with server for that purpose HTTP verb is also required

    REST API = HTTP verb + URL = e.g GET + 172.17.18.19/netflix/plans

    HTTP verb contains mainly following four things ->
    1)Get -> just to read or get data
    2)Post -> to create or write something
    3)Put --> modify
    4)Delete -> remove or delete


    in short REST API helps to transfer the information in the state between the user and server
