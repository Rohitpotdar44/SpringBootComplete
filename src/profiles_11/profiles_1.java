    see while making any type of product there are mainly two phases production and the development

    so we can see in the separate application.yml / application.properties file so according application is running on the production environment

    3 ways - > 1) application.yml / application.properties file
               2) inside the environment of the code editor
               3) through jar ->if test folder included then need to define first

    and we can also configure beans ( any class) by using e.g @Profile("dev")

    see nothing difficult just add spring.profiles.active=dev etc
