    see we are basically interacting with the database with the help of MongoRepository

    and for assessing something that has not any built in method in the MongoRepository

    then we  have to write that method in repository and then write it's implementaion where you want

    but there is a way that we can write the name of the method in such a way that it itself becomes a query

    so has it's specific rules then only that becomes a query called as criteria

    so now we are interacting with the DB using criteria

    now basically we are going to implement one feature that if the user's email id exists and is demand for

    sentimental analysis (mood) then based on the journal entries he/she get a mail
